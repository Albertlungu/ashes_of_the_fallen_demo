# ashes_of_the_fallen_demo

A calm lil RPG 3D Indie game for DAYDREAM GLOBALLLLLLL. Made with Godot editor using some files from the internet (i should prolly cite my sourcesðŸ˜°). Don't worry about the code, might've vibecoded some of it... BUT IT WORKS (at least this part for now)!


## What is it?
- Basically you just go with the flow of the game   
  - There's no book yet, but I'm prolly gonna add some sort of manual that tells the user all controls and stuff like that
  - For now, refer to this readme.md for keybinds and stuff
- There's 4 parts to it total:
  - Challenge 1: Trial of Wit
    - You have to solve a maze that looks too much like the backrooms
    - You get a gem that lets you slow down time of enemy by 2x (hopefully it works)   
      - Sacrifice 5% of max health per use
  - Challenge 2: Trial of Strength:
    - You needa cook some sort of alien monster
    - Not sure what you're gonna get as a reward yet
  - Challenge 3: I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO DO FOR THIS LAST ONE
  - Challenge 4: The Ultimate Sacrifice
    - So basically at the end you js kill urself
    - Yeah all that work js to murder your own character 
    - YOU SAVE THE WORLD THOUGH!!!
